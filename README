Breakdown - an ultra-light Markdown(-like) implementation

---

Breakdown implements a small subset of the Markdown language. See
http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for more info on that.

The idea behind Breakdown is to support only a very limited set of the entire
Markdown language, to allow very basic users to use it. So no HTML tags and
only one notation style for each supported style.

Breakdown (currently) (only) supports:
 # heading
 ## heading
 * bullet
 --- (horizontal line)
 ... *italic* ...
 ... **bold** ...
 ... [label](link) ...
 ... ![label](image) ...
 ... http://... ...
 and automatic paragraph detection.

I'll probably start making changes to the language itself - I already did when
dropping the diamond brackets around URLs ;-)

The goal is to provide completely identical implementations in both Javascript
and server-side languages. This allows the use of Javascript in the browser,
offering the user a real-time rendering of his/her work. On the server the
same work can also be converted to the identical HTML representation and be
sent to the browser as such.

Javascript

For now I've also copied the interface of Showdown, the Javascript
implementation of Markdown. See http://attacklab.net/showdown/ for more info.

Usage:
	var input = "Breakdown *rocks* too";
	var html  = new Breakdown.converter().makeHtml(input);
	alert(html); // Breakdown <em>rocks</em> too
